features:
  - title: Native
    icon: 🧬
    details: Built entirely on top of native Web Components and platform APIs — no virtual DOM, no runtime magic.

  - title: Small
    icon: 🪶
    details: Only 1 kB gzipped. That's 12× smaller than Stimulus, with all the power you actually need.

  - title: Fast
    icon: ⚡
    details: Optimized for server-rendered websites and instant interactivity. Load only what you use — nothing more.

  - title: Declarative
    icon: 🔖
    details: Use HTML-first patterns for props, parts, and behavior — all powered by attributes and native APIs.

  - title: Frameworkless
    icon: 🧩
    details: Works with any SSR backend — PHP, Astro, Laravel, Rails, whatever. No bundler or build step required.

  - title: Extensible
    icon: 🛠️
    details: Plug in Signals, LitHtml, or custom logic only when needed. Webuum won’t get in your way.
